# Regen Map

NOTE: This repository is just an exploration, and is mostly vibe coded. Do with that as you may.

## The Vision

The regen, sensemaking & wise tech space are oriented to bring sovereign identity, trust graphs, prosocial media, sensemaking tools and economic infrastructure into the world in a way that is easy to use and evolvable. It helps to know who, what and where these things are happening.

## The Future

This project aims at being a meeting point to find eachother across our network of networks. Some of the hard problems many of us have been working towards can be summarised as giving people an access point for verifiably claimable identity and social graphs.

Some of the technologies we are looking into using are:
