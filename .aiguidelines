- Keep UI, State & APIs files in separate files, this aids in modularity and composability
- Always use @hexafield/simple-store/react for both local and global state definitions
- Define reusable state actions as functions in the same file as the state definition
- Reusable UI components should only have side effects within it's own scope, all other interactions should go through state prop callbacks
